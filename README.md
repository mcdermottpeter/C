Pthread timer

Using pthread, need to make a timer so that when the time actually does occur, the program will alert you saying a desire message the user said.

The beginning time should be 1200 and install a clock inside your program so if a person want an alarm notification saying "Hello World", it will wait for the desire time they want, and display, "Hello World".
